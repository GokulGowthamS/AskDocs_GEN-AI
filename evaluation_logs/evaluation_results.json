    "ground_truth": "Scientific Class: Cephalopoda (includes squids, cuttlefish, nautiluses).\nOrder: Octopoda.\nNumber of Species: ~300 known species.\nHabitat: All oceans, mostly in coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed.\nLifespan: 1 to 5 years, depending on species.\nCognitive Abilities: Octopuses are highly intelligent—the smartest invertebrates. They can solve puzzles, escape enclosures, open jars, and even use tools. They exhibit both short-term and long-term memory. Some use coconut shells or shells for shelter, demonstrating tool use.\nSocial Behavior: Mostly solitary, but some species show social interactions (e.g., Octopolis in Australia). They show personalities—shy, curious, or aggressive.\nBrain Structure: Octopuses have 9 brains; 1 central brain and 8 smaller brains (one in each arm). Each arm can process information independently.\nVision: Highly developed eyes, comparable to those of vertebrates. Can detect polarized light. Technically colorblind but use their skin and polarized light to perceive contrast.\nCamouflage: Masters of camouflage, changing color and texture in milliseconds. Use specialized skin cells; chromatophores, iridophores, and leucophores.\nMimicry: Mimic octopuses can imitate sea snakes, lionfish, flatfish, and more to evade predators.\nArms: 8 arms with hundreds of suckers; each can grip and taste.\nNo Bones: Their soft body allows them to squeeze through tight spaces.\nBlue Blood: They use hemocyanin (copper-based), ideal for cold, low-oxygen water.\nJet Propulsion: Move by expelling water through a siphon.\nRegeneration: Can regrow lost limbs.\nReproduction: Breed only once (semelparous), then die. Males use a specialized arm (hectocotylus) to deliver sperm. Females lay thousands of eggs and guard them until they die. Some deep-sea species brood eggs for over 4 years which is the longest known brooding period in the animal kingdom.\nInk Ejection: Releases a dark cloud to obscure predators' vision and scent.\nJet Escape: Quick propulsion for escape.\nMimicry: Imitates venomous animals to deter predators.\nArm Autotomy: Sacrifices a limb to escape, then regrows it later.\nDeep Sea Variants: Dumbo Octopus (Grimpoteuthis)- Lives 3,000 to 7,000 meters deep.Has ear-like fins. Doesn’t use ink since it’s useless in the pitch-dark deep sea.\nBiomimicry: Inspired soft robots used in medical and underwater applications.\nRobotics: Their arm movements help in designing flexible robotic limbs.\nGenetics: 33,000 protein-coding genes (more than humans!).\nAlien Theory: Some scientists humorously suggest their biology is so unique, they could be “alien-like.”\nPop Culture: Appear in documentaries (My Octopus Teacher), films (Finding Dory, Pirates of the Caribbean), and mythology (e.g., Japanese Akkorokamui).\nFun Facts: A single sucker can lift up to 35 lbs. Famous escape artists—some have escaped aquariums into the sea. They can taste what they touch using receptors on their suckers. They experience REM-like sleep and might even dream.\n\nSummary:\n\nOctopuses are mind-blowingly unique:\n9 brains\n3 hearts\nBlue blood\nProblem-solvers and escape artists\nMasters of disguise\nPossibly dreamers\nTool users and independent thinkers",

    "question": "What is Velociraptor Scientific name?",
    "prediction": "the scientific name of velociraptor is velociraptor mongoliensis. according to the context provided, velociraptor is a small to medium-sized dromaeosaurid theropod that lived during the late cretaceous period (~75–71 million years ago) in the gobi desert of mongolia and northern china. velociraptor were carnivorous, feeding on small reptiles, mammals, and possibly carrion, and their anatomy and preserved features continue to offer insights into the evolution of flight, intelligence, and social behavior among theropods. fossil evidence suggests that velociraptor had feathers, with quill knobs found on the forearms of some fossils, indicating a bird-like appearance. velociraptor represent a transitional species between non-avian dinosaurs and modern birds, strengthening the evolutionary link between these two groups. while often depicted hunting in packs in popular culture, there is limited direct fossil evidence to support this theory, and their brain-to-body size ratio suggests high intelligence among dinosa",
